### Cub3D

## Description
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

# Presentation

The goal of this project was to create a basic first-person maze like the old Wolfenstein 3D, using raycasting.<br/>

**Features**<br/>

Mandatory part:
- A custom map can be create using a .cub file including :
  - Different wall textures that vary depending on which side the wall is facing (North, South, East, West).
  - Different floor and ceiling colors using RGB.
  - Doors and enemies position (X, Y).
  - The map file itself. (1 = wall, 0 = floor).
  - A player facing a direction (N, S, E, W)
- A 3D rendering of a map file.

Bonus part:
- Wall collisions.
- A minimap system.
- Doors which can open and close.
- Animated sprite (gun and enemies).
- Rotate the point of view with the mouse.
- Custom transparency.
